        <div class="confession-letter">
            <p>Dear Gie,</p>
            
            <p>I hope this letter finds you well. There's something I've been meaning to tell you, and I believe it's time to share my feelings with you. Over the past months, I've come to realize that I'm slowly falling deeply in love with you.
            And I want you to know that when times are hard I will always be here for you.
            I know this is just the beginning, especially now na nagsisimula palang akong manligaw sayo and now na nagsisimula palang tayong kilalanin isa't isa.</p>
            
            <p>Love, Don't hesitate to tell me if you feel uncomfortable with who I'm with or where I'm going, and don't hesitate to tell me what's going wrong,
            And please trust me, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm here to make sure you'll be treated right and to be loved the way you must.
            I know people come and go, and All I want is to stay for a very long time with you, build with you and grow old with you.
            Always communicate your feelings daily and clearly and please don't sleep angry at me or something misunderstanding.
            Don't be afraid to ask questions, tell stories and rants on me, because I will always be here ready to listen and communicate with you the best way possible.
            
            <p>If they ask me if I will still continue pursuing you even if it hurts and hard, I'm gonna tell you, yes It hurts and it's very hard.
            My one answer will always be yes. Oo, Omsim, yeah lahat ng possible na sagot na Oo sasabihin ko.
            You are worth the wait and worth the risk.
            Mas pipillin ko pa din manatili sa'yo at samahan ka mag-grow at maitama ang lahat kahit dumating pa tayo sa puntong di tayo masaya.
            Madali kang mahalin kung palaging may saya pero hindi totoo ang pagmamahal kung iwan at pababayaan kita kapag hindi na ko nakakaramdam ng saya.
            Mahal kita sa bawat oras na may saya, hirap, lungkot at sakit sa atin dalawa. Just trust me I'm not going to lose feelings, I'm not going to find someone better,
            I'm not going to cheat on you, and I'm not going to leave you.
            I have already made up my mind, I want you and only you.
            No one else, because to me you are my kind of woman.
            And I can't imagine my life without you.
            I love you and that's all Pure and simple.
            I know wala pa ako maipagmamalaki sayo, I'm not rich, I don't have those things and money and right now I maybe limited by all of my actions since money is still limited for a student like us. 
              But I will make my life better since I know you deserve's the best. and we will reach our dreams and goals. All I can offer to you right now is the unconditional Love
            and my true intentions towards you. </p>

            <p>Hi love wroting this letter just now, I know we had misunderstanding right now and I'm sorry for being immature earlier I admit my mistakes.
              Sorry for all the things I have done to you. You mean the world to me and I can't imagine my world without you.
